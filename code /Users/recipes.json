Forward: From the machine.
In an era where technology touches every aspect of our lives, it was only a matter of time before it entered our kitchens in a more profound way. "Artificially Plant-Based: Vegan Recipes Built by A.I." is a groundbreaking cookbook that stands at the crossroads of culinary art and artificial intelligence. This collection of vegan recipes, curated and crafted by an A.I., represents a new frontier in the world of cooking. 

What makes this book truly fascinating is not just its commitment to plant-based eating—a lifestyle choice celebrated for its health benefits, environmental sustainability, and ethical considerations—but also its method of creation. Using artificial intelligence as a chef opens up a world of creativity and innovation, challenging our traditional approaches to recipe development and food preparation. The A.I.'s ability to analyze and synthesize vast amounts of data on ingredients, cooking techniques, and flavor pairings has resulted in a collection of recipes that are both nutritious and tantalizingly delicious.

The implications of utilizing A.I. in this manner are profound. It demonstrates the potential for technology to enhance our creativity and expand our culinary horizons. By leveraging A.I., this book offers a glimpse into the future of cooking, where the boundaries of what is possible are continually being redefined. It invites readers to explore new flavors and ingredients, encouraging a deeper appreciation for the diversity and richness of plant-based cuisine.

Finally, the emphasis on a plant-based diet speaks to a growing awareness of the need for more sustainable and compassionate eating habits. The recipes in this book are designed not only to nourish the body but also to inspire a sense of responsibility towards our planet and its inhabitants. From hearty mains to delectable desserts, each recipe is a testament to the fact that choosing plant-based foods does not mean sacrificing flavor or satisfaction.

"Artificially Plant-Based" is more than just a cookbook; it's a celebration of innovation, creativity, and conscious eating. Whether you are a seasoned vegan or simply looking to incorporate more plant-based meals into your diet, this book offers something for everyone. It challenges us to rethink our relationship with food, to embrace the possibilities that technology brings, and to step boldly into a more sustainable and compassionate future.

Welcome to a new era of cooking.

Forward: From the human.
There’s a White Castle restaurant outside of Chicago that uses an automated robotic arm, powered by an artificial intelligence that allows the bot to know when to flip patties or drop fries. When I originally heard about the robot arm, I remembered my time working at Portillo’s Hot Dog restaurant as a fry boy and all the burn scars up my wrists from said job, plus just how crazy Saturday night dinner rushes could become. The robotic arm’s purpose is to protect White Castle employees from oil burns and to cover a simple task allowing human employees to interact more with customers. 

And I bet you weren’t expecting a greasy White Castle slider to be the inspiration for a vegan cookbook, were ya? 

All the following recipes were written by a generative A.I, program and assembled into this book by me, the human. I feel weird referring to myself as the author when I really didn’t write a word of any recipe. That being said; I did write every prompt fed into the A.I. for it to write every recipe. Every weird combination or idea came from my brain, so I may not be a typical “author” per say, but “prompt engineer” is the next big money word in the tech industry at the moment.   

This is probably one of the most rudimentary applications of artificial intelligence. I could be using this new technology to make myself rich by trading stocks, using it to advance our current medical understandings, or even help me with research projects.But food is what resonates with me. It’s an art form that is equal parts temporary (the food only lasts as long as dinner), but the recipe lasts forever with our families. On top of the meal bringing the family together to talk and celebrate each other’s presence. We incorporate the past, present, and future into every meal we cook and into every meal we eat together. 

With that, I hope you enjoy every recipe “Artificially Plant Based: Vegan Recipes Built by A.I.” bring together every important part of your past, present, and future. 

Timothy.

Easy Vegan Kimchi
Ingredients:

1 large Napa cabbage (about 2 pounds)
1 daikon radish, julienned
4 green onions, chopped
1 carrot, julienned (optional)
1/4 cup sea salt or kosher salt
1 tablespoon grated ginger
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 small onion, minced
2-3 tablespoons Korean red pepper flakes (gochugaru), adjust to taste
2 tablespoons sugar or a sweetener of your choice
3 tablespoons soy sauce or tamari (for a gluten-free option)
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
2 tablespoons miso paste (ensure it's vegan)

Instructions:

Cut the Napa cabbage in half lengthwise, then cut it into quarters. Remove the cores and chop the cabbage into bite-sized pieces.
Place the cabbage in a large mixing bowl and sprinkle with the salt.
Massage the salt into the cabbage until it starts to soften. Then, add enough water to cover the cabbage. Place a plate on top and weigh it down with something heavy. Let it sit for 1-2 hours.
After the cabbage has been sitting, rinse it thoroughly under cold water. Drain and squeeze out as much water as possible.
In a food processor, blend the ginger, garlic, onion, Korean red pepper flakes, sugar, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and miso paste until smooth.
In a large bowl, combine the drained cabbage with the paste. Use your hands (you might want to wear gloves) to thoroughly mix and massage the paste into the cabbage.
Add the daikon radish, green onions, and carrot to the cabbage mixture. Again, use your hands to ensure everything is well combined.
Pack the kimchi tightly into jars, pressing down on it to pack it tightly and to eliminate any air pockets. Leave about an inch of space at the top.
Seal the jars and let them sit at room temperature for 1-5 days. Check them daily and press down on the cabbage to keep it submerged in its juices. The fermentation time can vary depending on your taste preference and the temperature of your kitchen.
Once the kimchi is fermented to your liking, store it in the refrigerator. It will continue to ferment but at a much slower pace. It will keep for several months.

DESSERTS









Chocolate Pasta with Coconut Milk and Sprinkles
Ingredients:
8 ounces rotini pasta (preferably a whole wheat or a similar hearty variety to hold up to the sauce)
1 cup chocolate sauce (homemade or store-bought)
1/2 cup coconut milk (full-fat for creaminess)
Rainbow sprinkles for garnish
Directions:

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add a pinch of salt if desired.
Cook the rotini pasta according to the package instructions until it is al dente. You want the pasta to have a little bite to it since it will be served with a sauce.
While the pasta is cooking, gently warm the chocolate sauce in a saucepan over low heat. 
Once the chocolate sauce is warm, slowly stir in the coconut milk until you achieve a smooth and creamy consistency. Adjust the amount to your liking for thickness and creaminess.
Once the pasta is cooked to al dente, drain it well. Do not rinse the pasta as the starch helps the sauce cling to it.
Return the drained pasta to the pot (off the heat) or to a mixing bowl.
Pour the warm chocolate-coconut sauce over the pasta and gently toss until all the pasta is coated.
Serve the chocolate pasta in individual bowls or a large serving dish.
Garnish generously with rainbow sprinkles right before serving for a pop of color and a slight crunch.

Simple Vegan Marshmallows
Ingredients:

1/2 cup cold water, divided
1 1/2 tablespoons agar-agar powder (a vegan gelatin alternative)
1 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup light corn syrup
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Confectioners' sugar, for dusting

Instructions:

Lightly grease an 8x8-inch pan and dust it with confectioners' sugar to prevent sticking.
Bloom the Agar-Agar:
In a small saucepan, sprinkle the agar-agar powder over 1/4 cup of cold water. Let it sit for about 5 minutes to “bloom” (absorb the water).
Heat the agar-agar and water mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly until the agar completely dissolves (about 5-7 minutes).
In another saucepan, combine the remaining 1/4 cup water, granulated sugar, corn syrup, and salt. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat.
Continue boiling the mixture until it reaches the “soft ball” candy stage, or 240°F (115°C) on a candy thermometer. This usually takes about 10 minutes.
Once the sugar syrup reaches the correct temperature, remove it from the heat. Slowly and carefully pour it into the agar-agar mixture, stirring constantly.
Transfer the combined mixture to a large bowl (or stand mixer) and whip it on high speed for about 10-12 minutes, or until it becomes very thick, fluffy, and triples in volume. Add the vanilla extract during the last minute of whipping.
Quickly pour the whipped mixture into your prepared pan, smoothing the top with a spatula. Work quickly, as the mixture will start setting as it cools.
Let the marshmallows sit at room temperature for at least 4 hours, or overnight, until set and firm to the touch.
Once set, cut the marshmallows into squares using a knife or pizza cutter dusted with confectioners' sugar.
Toss each marshmallow in more confectioners' sugar to prevent sticking.
Store the marshmallows in an airtight container at room temperature. They are best used within a week.

Easy S'mores with Homemade Marshmallows
Ingredients:

Homemade vegan marshmallows (from the previous recipe)
Vegan graham crackers
Vegan chocolate bars (dark chocolate works well)

Instructions:

Carefully skewer the homemade vegan marshmallows.
Roast them over an open flame (like a campfire or a gas stove burner) until they are golden brown and melty. Be sure to turn them frequently for an even roast. If you don't have a flame source, you can broil them in the oven. Just watch them closely as they can burn quickly.
Break the graham crackers in half to create squares.
Place a piece of vegan chocolate on one half of each graham cracker. The heat from the marshmallow will help melt the chocolate.
Once the marshmallow is roasted to your liking, carefully place it on top of the chocolate piece.
Use another graham cracker square to sandwich the marshmallow. Press down gently to spread the melted marshmallow.
Allow the s'more to cool for a moment (the marshmallow will be very hot), and then enjoy the gooey, sweet treat.
Continue making more s'mores as desired. This is a fun and interactive dessert, perfect for gatherings or a cozy night in.

For the Coconut Filling:
2 cups unsweetened shredded coconut
1/3 cup coconut oil, melted
1/4 cup maple syrup or agave nectar
2 tablespoons coconut cream (the thick part from the top of a can of full-fat coconut milk)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

For the Chocolate Coating:
2 cups vegan dark chocolate chips
1 tablespoon coconut oil

Instructions:

In a mixing bowl, combine the shredded coconut, melted coconut oil, maple syrup or agave nectar, coconut cream, and vanilla extract. Mix well until everything is thoroughly combined and the mixture holds together when squeezed.
Shape the mixture into small oblong bars (similar to the shape of a traditional Mounds bar) using your hands. If the mixture is too sticky, chill it in the fridge for a few minutes before shaping.
Place the shaped bars on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Freeze the coconut bars for about 20-30 minutes, or until they are firm.
Melt the vegan dark chocolate chips with the tablespoon of coconut oil. You can use a double boiler or microwave the mixture in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until smooth.
Once the coconut bars are firm, dip each bar into the melted chocolate using a fork, ensuring they are completely coated.
Gently tap off any excess chocolate and place the bars back onto the parchment paper.
If you have leftover chocolate, you can drizzle it over the bars for an extra layer of chocolate.
Place the chocolate-coated bars in the refrigerator for the chocolate to harden, about 15-30 minutes.
Once the chocolate has set, your vegan Mounds bars are ready to be enjoyed!
Store any leftover bars in an airtight container in the fridge to keep them firm.

Kit Kat Style Bars
Ingredients:

Vegan wafer biscuits (Check the ingredients to ensure they're vegan. You can use plain vanilla-flavored wafers.)
2 cups vegan chocolate chips or chopped vegan chocolate bars
1 tablespoon coconut oil

Instructions:
Depending on the size of your wafers and how large you want your Kit Kat bars to be, you may need to trim the wafers with a knife to get the desired size. Kit Kats typically have a long, narrow shape.
Melt the vegan chocolate chips or chopped chocolate with coconut oil. You can use a double boiler method or melt it in the microwave. If using a microwave, heat in 30-second intervals, stirring between each interval until smooth.
Lay a piece of parchment paper on a flat surface or a baking sheet.
Dip each wafer biscuit into the melted chocolate, ensuring it is completely covered. Use a fork to lift the wafer out of the chocolate, gently tapping to remove excess chocolate.
Carefully place each chocolate-coated wafer on the parchment paper.
For a thicker Kit Kat bar with multiple layers, you can stack two chocolate-covered wafers together, then re-dip the double stack into the chocolate for an extra layer.
Place the chocolate-coated wafers in the refrigerator or freezer until the chocolate is firm, about 15-30 minutes.
Once the chocolate has set and hardened, your vegan Kit Kat bars are ready to be enjoyed.
Store any leftover bars in an airtight container in the fridge to keep them firm.

Chocolate Mug Cake
Ingredients:

4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons cocoa powder
2 tablespoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
A pinch of salt
5 tablespoons plant-based milk (almond, soy, oat, etc.)
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
Optional: Vegan chocolate chips, a scoop of peanut butter, or sliced banana

Instructions:

In a microwave-safe mug, mix flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
Stir in plant-based milk and vegetable oil until the batter is smooth. Mix in any optional additions like chocolate chips.
Microwave on high for about 1-2 minutes, until the cake rises and sets. (Microwave times may vary.)
Let it cool for a minute before enjoying.

Banana Pudding
Ingredients:

2 cups almond milk (or any plant-based milk of your choice)
1/3 cup sugar
3 tablespoons cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 ripe bananas, mashed
Additional 2 ripe bananas, sliced
Vegan vanilla wafers (check the label to ensure they're vegan)
Vegan whipped cream
A sprinkle of cinnamon or grated vegan chocolate

Instructions:
In a saucepan, whisk together the almond milk, sugar, cornstarch, and salt. Make sure the cornstarch is fully dissolved.
Place the saucepan over medium heat. Bring the mixture to a simmer, whisking constantly to avoid lumps.
Once the mixture thickens (this should take about 5-7 minutes), remove it from the heat.
Stir in the mashed bananas and vanilla extract. Mix well until everything is incorporated.
Transfer the pudding to a bowl. Cover it with plastic wrap, ensuring the wrap touches the surface of the pudding to prevent a skin from forming.
Chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, or until the pudding is set and cold.
In serving glasses or a large pudding dish, start by layering vegan vanilla wafers at the bottom.
Add a layer of sliced bananas over the wafers.
Pour a layer of the chilled banana pudding over the bananas and wafers.
Repeat the layers until all components are used up, finishing with a layer of pudding on top.
Just before serving, add a dollop of vegan whipped cream on top of each serving.
Sprinkle with a little cinnamon or grated vegan chocolate for an extra touch.
Serve the banana pudding chilled. It’s a creamy, comforting dessert with the natural sweetness of bananas.

Fruit Cobbler
Ingredients:

4 cups mixed fresh fruit (such as berries, peaches, apples, or pears, depending on the season)
1/3 cup sugar (adjust based on the sweetness of the fruit)
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
A pinch of cinnamon or nutmeg (optional)
1 cup all-purpose flour (for a gluten-free option, use a gluten-free flour blend)
1/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup vegan butter, cold and cubed
1/4 cup plant-based milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Instructions:

Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large bowl, mix together the fresh fruit, sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, vanilla extract, and cinnamon or nutmeg if using. Pour the fruit mixture into a baking dish (about 9x9 inches or similar size).
In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add the cold, cubed vegan butter to the flour mixture. Using a fork or pastry cutter, cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the plant-based milk and vanilla extract to form a thick batter.
Drop spoonfuls of the cobbler topping over the fruit filling, covering it in an even layer. You can leave some fruit peeking through for a rustic look.
Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the fruit filling is bubbly and the topping is golden brown.
Let the cobbler cool slightly before serving. It can be enjoyed warm or at room temperature.
Optional: Serve with a scoop of vegan ice cream or a dollop of vegan whipped cream.

Strawberry Crumble

1/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup coconut oil, melted (or vegan butter)

Instructions:

Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large bowl, combine the strawberries, sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and vanilla extract. Toss gently to coat the strawberries evenly.
Transfer the strawberry mixture to a baking dish (around 9x9 inches or similar).
In another bowl, mix together the rolled oats, flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt.
Pour the melted coconut oil over the oat mixture and stir until the mixture is crumbly and well combined. Sprinkle the crumble topping evenly over the strawberry filling.
Bake in the preheated oven for about 30-35 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the strawberry filling is bubbly.
Allow the crumble to cool slightly before serving. It can be enjoyed warm or at room temperature.
Optional: Serve with a scoop of vegan ice cream or a dollop of vegan whipped cream.
